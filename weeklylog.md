# Weekly Log

> **Week of:** YYYY-MM-DD  
> **Project:** [Project Name]

## What surprised you this week?

**Unexpected events or outcomes:**
1. [Event 1]: [What happened + why it was surprising]
2. [Event 2]: [What happened + why it was surprising]

*Or: "Nothing significant"*

**Rule:** Only include genuine surprises, not expected variance.

---

## What assumption broke?

**Assumptions that proved wrong:**
1. **Assumption:** [What you thought was true]  
   **Reality:** [What actually happened]  
   **Impact:** [How this changes decisions]

*Or: "No assumptions broke this week"*

**Rule:** An assumption breaks when reality contradicts your working model.

---

## What did users actually do?

**Observed behavior vs. expectation:**
1. **Expected:** [What you thought users would do]  
   **Actual:** [What they actually did]  
   **Insight:** [What this reveals]

*Or: "Behavior matched expectations" or "No user data this week"*

**Rule:** Only include if there's a meaningful divergence from expectations.

---

## What blocked you?

**Impediments to progress:**
1. **Blocker:** [What stopped or slowed work]  
   **Duration:** [How long it blocked you]  
   **Resolution:** [How it was resolved, or "still blocked"]

*Or: "No blockers this week"*

**Rule:** Include only blockers that consumed >2 hours or prevented story completion.

---

## What did you learn?

**New information that changes thinking:**
1. **Learning:** [What you discovered]  
   **Source:** [Where this came from: user feedback, bug, research, etc.]  
   **Implication:** [How this affects future decisions]

*Or: "No significant learnings this week"*

**Rule:** Only include learnings that should influence future plans.

## Schema Validation

<!-- This section is auto-validated -->

**Required sections present:**
- [ ] What surprised you?
- [ ] What assumption broke?
- [ ] What did users actually do?
- [ ] What blocked you?
- [ ] What did you learn?

**Content requirements:**
- [ ] Each section has at least one entry OR explicit "None" statement
- [ ] Surprises are specific, not vague ("slow progress" ❌, "API timeout increased 400%" ✅)
- [ ] Blockers quantify time impact
- [ ] Learnings connect to future decisions

**Enforcement mode:**
- [ ] On-save validation is warning-only
- [ ] Planning/execution is blocked if required sections/signals are missing

## Guidelines

**This is NOT:**
- ❌ A diary of daily activities
- ❌ A complete list of completed tasks
- ❌ A personal journal
- ❌ A place for blame or venting
- ❌ A dumping ground for random thoughts

**This IS:**
- ✅ A signal log for decision-making
- ✅ A record of broken assumptions
- ✅ A feedback mechanism for planning
- ✅ A lightweight, async note-taking tool

**How to use it:**
- Update throughout the week (2-3 min each time)
- Add items only when they cross a significance threshold
- Be honest about blockers (no hero syndrome)
- Quantify when possible (time, %, count)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Writing a novel (keep entries <3 sentences)
- Listing every small surprise (focus on decision-relevant)
- Postponing until planning session (capture in the moment)
- Using it as a todo list (belongs in Jira)

**Example entries:**

**Good:**
> **Surprise:** User retention dropped 15% after onboarding change (expected +5%)  
> **Learning:** Users need video tutorial, not text guide (3 user interviews confirmed)  
> **Blocker:** AWS deployment failing due to IAM permissions, took 6 hours to resolve

**Bad:**
> **Surprise:** Things didn't go as planned  
> **Learning:** Need to work harder  
> **Blocker:** Was busy this week
