          # 2. Enforce Format: "Start with Capital ... end with Ticket"
          # Regex breakdown:
          # ^[A-Z]        -> Subject must start with an Uppercase letter
          # .+            -> Followed by any text
          # \s            -> Followed by a space
          # [A-Z]+-[0-9]+ -> Followed by Ticket Key (e.g., OR-25)
          # $             -> End of string
          subjectPattern: ^[A-Z].+\s[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$

            The PR title does not match the required format!
            
            ✅ Correct Example:
            "feat: Add user login page OR-25"
            
            ❌ Incorrect Examples:
            "feat: add user login" (Lowercase subject, no ticket)
            "feat: Add user login" (Missing ticket)
            "feat: Add user login OR-25 #done" (Extra text after ticket)
