## Guidelines

**What to include:**
- Facts, not opinions
- Quantified metrics, not feelings
- Current state, not future plans
- Blockers, not blame

**What NOT to include:**
- Strategy or roadmap (belongs in plan.yaml)
- Historical context (unless directly relevant)
- Team dynamics or HR issues
- Personal notes (belongs in weeklylog.md)

**Update frequency:**
- Minimum: Once per week (before planning session)
- Maximum: Daily (if reality changes significantly)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Copying from Jira without interpretation
- Listing every ticket (summarize themes)
- Vague status ("almost done", "making progress")
- Missing blockers (be honest about impediments)
